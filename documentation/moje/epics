Syscall tracker
As a programmer I want to be able to know how many syscalls some platform made since it has started.

Target is to create proof of concept tracker, which can track syscalls. 
For this purpose I must learn ow to use berkeley packet filter.
Also I must learn how to run program on kernel level.

Acceptance criteria:
 - learn how to use barkeley packet fitler
 - find out how I want to implement bachelor implementation
 - tracker is able to track syscalls of some platform thanks to barkeley packet fitler on kernel level

As a programmer, I want to have logging app, that will collect some info (network utilization, syscalls) in GNU/Linux.
-----
We would like to monitor some main program, if it works as expected and how many resources it needs, so we need some light-weighted logging app that wont slow down main program.
There are already some apps like this, but they are paid or too complicated. They are going to be compared with this program.

Acceptance criteria:
We have app, that tracks main program.
- core app can log how much resources program use(probably we will use config file, what we want to log in every run)

1. story - creating threads
As a programmer, I want to find out, how to work with multiple threads.
------
Our app will have each thread under control, so we need to find out, how to create/stop threads. We can probably use some light-weighted library to manage it.

Acceptance criteria:
We can easily start/stop every thread
########################
2. story - communication with threads
As a programmer, I need to have core app that can easily communicate with every thread. Every thread will take care of different resource, we want to log.
-----
We want our threads to communicate with core app throught some light weight messages. Core app will log them.

Acceptance criteria:
We can send some messages between core app and threads
########################
3. story - threads send structured data and core app processes it
As a programmer, I need to send structured data between core and threads and I need to process it.
----
We need to send messages with many types, that will be logged and diveded by message types. We also have to check, if thread works as expected. 
(core app probably sends some control messages every few seconds)

Acceptance criteria:
We can send structured messages to core app
Core app can send control messages to check if every thread works
########################
4. story - logging specification
As a programmer, I need to have core app to receive logs and save them to file.
----
We want to create multiple threads and receive data from them.
We will use config file for core app and threads (like how often send logs, what to check, etc.).
Core app will receive logs from threads and save them into files in folder.
If core app receives some error message from some thread, core app will save it to special file.

Acceptance criteria:
We have core app to receive logs 
Core app can process logs and save them to files

As a programmer, I want to have app, which can determine from logs if program is able to run on other platform depends on his specification.
